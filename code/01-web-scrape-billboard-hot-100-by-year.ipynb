    "1. Scrape Wiki for the Hot 100 data that is needed (song, artist, year on Hot 100)\n",

    "The Hot 100 officially began on Monday, August 4, 1958 and the No. column records the order of songs that have made it onto the Hot 100. This may be useful as an index further down the line so I will keep it in the dataframe. The next and last thing I want to do to clean this data is to remove all duplicate entries. We have duplicate entries now because of the original data scrape including both the date the song was made #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the day it left #1. Additionally, some songs returned to the Hot 100 in multiple years, causing them to be entered another time with their position in the now removed 'No.' column being recorded as 're'. Since I have removed the column corresponding to that there isn't a need for the duplicate entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "When removing duplicates I wanted to be careful not to remove entries with the same song name but different artists. Over the years there have been a number of songs that have been re-recorded by new artists years after their original fame. At times, the re-recording can even have an entirely different sound then the previous version. This would provide much different metadata for each of the versions thus improving our recommender. As such, I will remove duplicates entries where there is a matching song name and artist, rather then just simply by song name. I will disregard the year column as I would be fine losing songs performed by the same artist that appear in the Hot 100 in multiple years at this time."
